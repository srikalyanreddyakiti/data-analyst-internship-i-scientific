A smart transformer health monitoring system using weighted performance indicators and a health index.

# Transformer Health Index Monitoring

This project was developed during my internship at iScientific Tech and focuses on monitoring transformer health using a calculated Health Index formula. The goal is to assess transformer performance based on key parameters and predict potential failures before they happen.

## üîç Overview

Transformers are critical for power transmission. Their failure can lead to large-scale outages and costly repairs. This system calculates a **Transformer Health Index (THI)** using real-time operational data such as:

- Temperature at R, Y, B phases  
- Current at R, Y, B phases  
- Oil temperature

Each parameter is scored and weighted to produce a single health index value (0 to 1) that indicates the condition of the transformer.

## üìä Health Index Formula

The formula used to compute the health index is:

```
Health Index = (0.2 √ó TR_score) + (0.2 √ó TY_score) + (0.2 √ó TB_score) +  
               (0.15 √ó IR_score) + (0.15 √ó IY_score) + (0.1 √ó IB_score) + (0.1 √ó TO_score)
```

Each indicator is normalized using:
```
Indicator Score = (Value - Min) / (Max - Min)
```

## üß† Key Features
