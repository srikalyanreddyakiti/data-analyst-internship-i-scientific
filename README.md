A smart transformer health monitoring system using weighted performance indicators and a health index.

# Transformer Health Index Monitoring

This project was developed during my internship at iScientific Tech and focuses on monitoring transformer health using a calculated Health Index formula. The goal is to assess transformer performance based on key parameters and predict potential failures before they happen.

## 🔍 Overview

Transformers are critical for power transmission. Their failure can lead to large-scale outages and costly repairs. This system calculates a **Transformer Health Index (THI)** using real-time operational data such as:

- Temperature at R, Y, B phases  
- Current at R, Y, B phases  
- Oil temperature

Each parameter is scored and weighted to produce a single health index value (0 to 1) that indicates the condition of the transformer.

## 📊 Health Index Formula

The formula used to compute the health index is:

```
Health Index = (0.2 × TR_score) + (0.2 × TY_score) + (0.2 × TB_score) +  
               (0.15 × IR_score) + (0.15 × IY_score) + (0.1 × IB_score) + (0.1 × TO_score)
```

Each indicator is normalized using:
```
Indicator Score = (Value - Min) / (Max - Min)
```

## 🧠 Key Features

- Customizable weights for transformer-specific conditions  
- Health index output to guide predictive maintenance  
- Scalable design for integration with machine learning models
